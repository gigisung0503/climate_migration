The Census assigns these geocodes based on “ZIP plus 4” codes and State of residence reported on the tax return.  The “plus 4” codes actually consist of a pair of two-character codes—a sector code and a segment code.  According to U.S. Post Office guidelines, each sector code identifies a single county.  Using the combination of ZIP sector codes and State of residence codes for each individual return, Census assigns each record a State/county geocode.  To prepare the migration data, which examine year-to-year changes, Census must geocode 2 consecutive filing years of IMF data.  County equivalent codes are assigned to the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, APO/FPO (military), and “other foreign” areas.\n","\t\n","#### <center><b><U> Identifying Migrants </U> </b></center>\n","\n","   Once the geographic codes are assigned, Census determines who in the file has, or has not, migrated.  To do this; \n","  -  first, coded returns for the current filing year are matched to coded returns filed during the prior year. \n","   \n","  - The mailing addresses on the two returns are then compared to one another focusing on:  (1) the street address and (2) State plus ZIP code. \n","   \n","  - <b>If the two are identical, the return is labeled a <font color='red'>“non-migrant.”</font></b>\n","  \n","  -If any of the above information changed between the 2 years, the return is considered a mover.  However, <b>the return is only classified a <font color='red'>“migrant” </font> if the taxpayer’s geographic code also changed from one year to the next.</b>\n","  \n","  - For cases in which the <b> geographic code did change from one year to the next</b>, a taxpayer is considered an <b><font color='red'>“in-migrant” </font></b> for the address on the return filed in the current filing year, and an <font color='red'><b> “out-migrant” </b></font> for the address on the return filed for the prior year.  \n","\n","#### <center><b><U> Limitations and Margin of Error in dataset:</U> </b></center>\n","\n","   Although the filer’s return address determines the migration status of the record, there are instances for which the taxpayer may not have changed residences but the return address suggests a move.  This may happen if:  \n","   1.  the filing address is that of a financial institution or tax preparer, and not that of the actual taxpayer; \n","   2.  the taxpayer is a college student living away from home who filed with a home address one year and the college address another; \n","   3.  the taxpayer reports his or her place of business as the return address; \n","   4.  the taxpayer maintains dual residences, primarily residing in one county but filing the tax return from the other; or \n","   5.  the taxpayer uses a post office box for mailing purposes.\n","\n","As mentioned, those who are not required to file United States Federal income tax returns are not included in this file, and so <b>the data under-represent the poor and the elderly</b>.  Also excluded is the small percentage of tax returns filed after late September of the filing year.  Most taxpayers whose returns are filed after this date have been granted an extension to file by the IRS.  These taxpayers are likely to have complex returns that report relatively high income, and so the migration data set may under-represent the very wealthy, as well.\n","\n","   The matching process also causes some returns to be excluded from the counts.  <b>When the current-year tax return is compared to the prior-year tax return, only the Social Security Number of the primary taxpayer is considered.</b>  If a secondary filer exists (as in the case of a married couple filing jointly), that Social Security Number is not recorded or compared in creating the migration dataset.  If, for example, a husband and wife file a joint return in the prior year, but divorce and file separately in the current year, only the husband’s current-year return will have a match with the prior-year return.  The now ex-wife’s current-year return becomes a non-match and will not be included in the data counts.  Other changes in filing status—from from joint to married filing separately—will also affect the data.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Sk_VvjGhjGq3"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"eJS5MLmPQvpB"},"outputs":[],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/gdrive')\n","import glob as glob\n","import pandas as pd\n","!pip install xlrd --upgrade\n","!pip install patool"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install patool\n","import patoolib"],"metadata":{"id":"rCmXu6LSBzgO"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# ETL Inflow Files"],"metadata":{"id":"l36uoytFeYGb"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Unzip rar file "],"metadata":{"id":"qwDsL_7f_Kzp"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","\n","1.
