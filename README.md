ETL and EDA processing for predicting climate migration.</br></br>


**summary**: Conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and developed an ETL pipeline to analyze U.S. Population Migration data, aiming to derive a "Internal Migration" signal indicative of residential market demand. This project involved data manipulation, analysis, and visualization to uncover patterns of internal migration at the county level. </br></br>

**Technical Details**:</br>
ETL Process: Designed and implemented an ETL pipeline to extract data from various formats and years, transform the data by cleaning and standardizing it, and load the processed data for analysis.</br>
EDA: Employed statistical and visual analysis techniques to explore migration trends, identify high migration areas, and calculate net migration flows. Utilized Python libraries such as GeoPandas for data manipulation, Plotly and Plotly Express for interactive visualizations, and seaborn for statistical plots.
